# About Kryonex

Kryonex is a metasearch engine, aggregating the results of other search engines while not storing information about its users. 

Kryonex may not offer personalized results like Google, but it doesn’t create a profile about you.

Kryonex doesn’t care what you search for, never shares anything with third parties, and can’t be used to compromise you.

Kryonex is free software, the code is 100% open, and everyone is welcome to make it better.

If you care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or believe in digital freedom, make Kryonex your default search engine or run it on your own server!
