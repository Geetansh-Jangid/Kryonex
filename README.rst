Privacy-respecting, hackable `metasearch engine`_

It's a customised version of Searxng. 

# Setup

- Just run app.py lol

# Purpose

I didn't code a search engine, I have optimised searxng according to my needs and my preferences, additionally I changed the theme to amoled. And named it as Kryonex.
